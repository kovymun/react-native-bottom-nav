### Description and Purpose

This project is a small **front-end mobile application** built using **React Native** and styled with the native **StyleSheet API**. **Help Mate** is a fictitious **task outsourcing platform** created to showcase a clean and intuitive **bottom tab navigation bar**, highlighting essential **UI/UX practices** in mobile app design and functionality. Effective navigation is crucial in mobile applications as it directly impacts user experience, helping users move through the app effortlessly and find what they need without hassle. The project serves as a practical example of implementing bottom tab navigation in mobile interfaces.

### Tech Stack
