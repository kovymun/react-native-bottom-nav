### Description and Purpose

This project is a small **front-end mobile application** built using **React Native** and styled with the native **StyleSheet API**. **Help Mate** is a fictitious **task outsourcing platform** created to showcase a clean and intuitive **bottom tab navigation bar**, highlighting essential **UI/UX practices** in mobile app design and functionality. Effective navigation is crucial in mobile applications as it directly impacts user experience, helping users move through the app effortlessly and find what they need without hassle. The project serves as a practical example of implementing bottom tab navigation in mobile interfaces.

### Tools and Programming languages used

- React Native built with Expo
- Expo Router
- Stylesheet API

#### Additional Libraries:

- **@expo/vector-icons** - Used to provide customizable icons for the navigation tabs.

#### Other:

- **Code Editor / IDE:** I would recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio code (VS Code) as your preferred code editor / IDE to explore this project. If you do not have VS Code installed and require assistance with downloading and installation, please refer to this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview
- **Expo Go Application:** The **Expo Go app** is essential for previewing and testing your React Native projects on your mobile device in real-time. It allows you to run your app without needing a physical device setup or simulator, as long as you have the app installed. Simply scan the QR code generated by Expo while the app is running, and youâ€™ll see the changes reflected instantly on your device as you code.
